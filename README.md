# LLM Certification for Financial Services

Automated LLM model certification pipeline using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) experiments and open-source financial evaluation datasets. Powered by [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) as the analytics backend.

**The problem:** Certifying a new LLM (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-4o) for use in financial services takes weeks of manual testing - sending prompts, collecting responses, scoring accuracy, writing compliance reports. Model risk management teams need standardized, reproducible evidence before approving models for production. And certification isn't one-and-done: prompts get promoted, models get swapped, and production traffic drifts — the evidence has to stay current.

**This pipeline:** Load golden financial datasets into Langfuse, run them against any model — or against a multi-step **agent**, for [use-case certification](#use-case-certification-agents) — through a single command, automatically score with financial evaluators, and export results for compliance reports. What took 2 weeks becomes 1 day.

**The loop:** The pieces form Langfuse's [AI Engineering Loop](docs/ai-engineering-loop.md) (Trace → Monitor → Build Datasets → Experiment → Evaluate) end to end: production failures are promoted back into golden datasets, and promoting a prompt in Langfuse automatically re-runs the affected certification in CI.

## Architecture

The pipeline implements Langfuse's AI Engineering Loop — **Trace → Monitor → Build Datasets →
Experiment → Evaluate** — as a cycle, with Langfuse as the system of record for datasets, traces,
scores, prompts, and review queues:

```

     |                  +------------------------+
     |
     | Edge A -- observe -> develop: promote_trace_to_dataset.py --from-queue
     | (flagged trace -> dataset item `prod-<traceId>`; a human supplies the answer)

 MONITOR                +------------------------+     TRACE
```

The top row is the certification path; the bottom row is production observability. The two
feedback edges close the loop: **Edge A** turns reviewed production failures into golden dataset
items (the next run regression-tests them), and **Edge B** re-certifies automatically whenever a
managed prompt is promoted in Langfuse.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- Node.js 20+ / npm 10+ (to build the certification portal frontend)
- A Langfuse instance — see [Choose your Langfuse deployment](#choose-your-langfuse-deployment) below
- An LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- Docker 24+ with Compose v2 — only if you self-host Langfuse

## Choose your Langfuse deployment

The pipeline talks to Langfuse purely through `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`,
`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`, so the same code runs against
either deployment. Pick one before running Quick Start.

| | Langfuse Cloud (recommended) | Self-hosted (OSS) |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | Fastest evaluation, no infra to manage | Air-gapped environments, strict data-residency requirements |
| Setup time | ~2 min (signup) | ~10 min (Docker Compose) |
| Cost | Free tier with paid plans above (see [pricing](https://langfuse.com/pricing)) | Infrastructure only — Langfuse OSS is Apache 2.0 |
| Data residency | Langfuse-managed (EU or US region) | Your infrastructure |
| Maintenance | None | You operate Postgres, ClickHouse, Redis, MinIO |
| Prerequisite for this repo | A Cloud account | Docker 24+ with Compose v2 |

### Option A — Langfuse Cloud

1. Sign up at <https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up> (EU) or
   <https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up> (US).
2. Create an **Organization → Project**.
3. **Settings → API Keys → Create new API keys**. Copy the public + secret keys.
4. Paste them into `.env` (created in [Quick Start step 1](#1-setup)). The
   `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` already defaults to `https://cloud.langfuse.com`;
   uncomment the US-region line in `.env.example` if you signed up there.

### Option B — Self-host Langfuse

The repo ships a curated Docker Compose stack with Langfuse pinned to v3. From
the repo root:

```bash
docker compose -f selfhost/docker-compose.yml up -d
# Open http://localhost:3000 → sign up → create Organization + Project →
# Settings → API Keys → Create new API keys
```

Then in [Quick Start step 1](#1-setup), uncomment the self-hosted line in
`.env.example` (and comment the Cloud default) so `.env` ends up with:

```bash
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

See [`selfhost/README.md`](selfhost/README.md) for stop/reset commands,
network-exposure guidance, credential rotation, and pointers to production
self-hosting via Kubernetes. If you plan to run the full 150-item FinanceBench
dataset against a local stack, also read
[Troubleshooting: hangs on long runs](#troubleshooting-hangs-on-long-runs) —
local Langfuse can saturate the OTel queue on long, CoT-heavy runs.

> **Recommendation:** start with Cloud's free tier to get the pipeline running
> end-to-end, then move to self-hosted if compliance or data-residency
> requirements demand it. The certification scripts, evaluators, dataset
> loaders, portal, and CI workflows are identical for both deployments.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doneyli/langfuse-llm-certification-finance.git
cd langfuse-llm-certification-finance
cp .env.example .env    # Edit with your Langfuse + LLM API credentials
```

> The `.env.example` lists three `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` options (Cloud EU, Cloud
> US, self-hosted) — uncomment exactly one and comment the others before
> running anything. See
> [Choose your Langfuse deployment](#choose-your-langfuse-deployment).

**Install dependencies** (choose one):

```bash
# Recommended: using uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
uv sync

# Alternative: using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The examples below use `uv run` which auto-creates a virtualenv and installs
> dependencies. If you installed with pip, drop the `uv run` prefix and use
> `python` directly.

### 2. Load Sample Dataset (offline, no HuggingFace needed)

```bash
uv run python setup_datasets.py --dataset financebench --sample
```

### 3. Set Up Langfuse Configuration

```bash
uv run python setup_score_configs.py        # Register score types in Langfuse
uv run python setup_annotation_queues.py    # Create human review queue
uv run python setup_prompts.py              # Register prompt templates
```

### 4. Run Certification

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --queue-failures
```

### 5. Build the Portal Frontend

```bash
cd portal/frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
```

### 6. Launch the Portal

```bash
uv run python -m portal.app    # Opens on http://localhost:8050
```

### 7. View Results

Open `http://localhost:8050` for the Certification Dashboard, or Langfuse UI > **Datasets** > `certification/financebench-sample` > **Runs**

### 8. Review Failed Items

Open your Langfuse UI > **Annotation Queues** > `Certification Review` to review items that failed automated evaluation.

### 9. Export Report

```bash
uv run python export_results.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample
uv run python export_results.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample --format json --output report.json
```

## Full Dataset Mode

To load all 150 FinanceBench items from HuggingFace (requires internet):

```bash
uv run python setup_datasets.py --dataset financebench        # Downloads from HuggingFace
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-v1 --model gpt-4o
```

## Components

### `setup_datasets.py` - Dataset Loader

Loads golden financial datasets into Langfuse from HuggingFace or embedded sample files.

```
Options:
  --dataset {financebench,fpb,advisory-adversarial,all}
                                     Which dataset(s) to load (default: all —
                                     covers financebench + fpb; advisory-adversarial
                                     is opt-in only)
  --sample                           Use embedded sample data (offline mode)
  --prefix PREFIX                    Dataset name prefix (default: certification)
  --dry-run                          Preview without creating
```

**Supported datasets:**

| Dataset | Items | Source | Focus |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| `financebench` | 10 (sample) / 150 (full) | [PatronusAI/financebench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/financebench) | Financial QA from SEC filings |
| `fpb` | 10 (sample) / ~4850 (full) | [ChanceFocus/en-fpb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChanceFocus/en-fpb) | Financial sentiment classification |
| `advisory-adversarial` | 2 (embedded) | `sample_data/advisory_adversarial.json` | Client-update briefs that tempt non-compliant advisory language |

`advisory-adversarial` loads as `certification/advisory-adversarial` (no `-sample`/`-v1` suffix)
and is deliberately excluded from `--dataset all`. It exists to demo the `advisory-draft` agent's
hard compliance gate: run it with `ADVISORY_TEMPT_NONCOMPLIANT=1` and the agent is nudged toward
prohibited phrasing, so the compliance dimension fails the whole certification even when every
other score is perfect.

> **Caveat:** `setup_datasets.py` creates dataset *items* without stable ids, so re-running it
> against an already-loaded dataset duplicates the items (the dataset itself is created
> idempotently). `promote_trace_to_dataset.py`, by contrast, upserts items by id and is safe to
> re-run.

### `setup_score_configs.py` - Score Config Setup

Registers score configurations in Langfuse for all evaluators. This gives scores proper types, value ranges, and descriptions in the Langfuse UI. Also creates human review score configs for annotation queues. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

```
Options:
  --dry-run    Preview configs without creating
```

### `setup_annotation_queues.py` - Annotation Queue Setup

Creates annotation queues in Langfuse for human review of certification results. Queues are linked to the human review score configs. Requires `setup_score_configs.py` to be run first. Idempotent.

```
Options:
  --dry-run    Preview queues without creating
```

### `setup_prompts.py` - Prompt Template Setup

Registers certification prompt templates in Langfuse prompt management. Once created, prompts can be edited, versioned, and promoted in the Langfuse UI without code changes.

```
Options:
  --dry-run    Preview prompts without creating
```

**Managed prompts:**

| Prompt | Variables | Used For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `financial-qa` | `{{evidence}}`, `{{question}}` | FinanceBench items with filing excerpts (model cert) |
| `financial-sentiment` | `{{text}}` | Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification (model cert) |
| `usecase-10k-analyst-compose` | `{{question}}`, `{{operands}}`, `{{computed}}`, `{{citations}}` | 10-K Analyst agent — compose step |
| `usecase-sentiment-classify` | `{{text}}` | Sentiment Triage agent — classify step |
| `usecase-advisory-analyze` | `{{question}}`, `{{evidence}}` | Advisory Drafting agent — analyze step |
| `usecase-advisory-draft` | `{{facts}}` | Advisory Drafting agent — draft step |

Only the free-form agent steps are Langfuse-managed. The 10-K Analyst's *plan* and *extract*
steps emit JSON the agent parses, so their prompts stay code-owned
(`agents/financial_analyst.py`) to keep parsing stable against UI edits.

### `monitor_production.py` - Production Monitor

Fetches recent production traces from Langfuse and runs deterministic evaluators (compliance, completeness) on any unscored traces. Designed to run on a schedule for continuous monitoring.

```
Options:
  --hours N              Look back N hours (default: 1)
  --tags TAG [TAG ...]   Filter traces by tags
  --trace-name NAME      Filter traces by name
  --limit N              Max traces to process (default: 100)
  --queue-violations     Route flagged traces to the human-review queue (feedback edge)
  --dry-run              Preview without posting scores
```

Exits with code 1 if compliance violations are detected, enabling integration with alerting systems.

### `promote_trace_to_dataset.py` - Feedback Loop (trace → golden dataset)

Closes the observation → development feedback edge of the [AI Engineering Loop](docs/ai-engineering-loop.md): promotes a flagged/reviewed production trace into a golden dataset item so the next certification run regression-tests it. Human-gated — it captures the trace *input* but leaves the correct answer to a reviewer (or `--expected`), never copying the suspect trace output as ground truth. Idempotent (item id `prod-<traceId>`, linked via `source_trace_id`).

```
Options:
  --dataset NAME         Target dataset (required, e.g. certification/financebench-sample)
  --trace-id ID          Trace to promote (repeatable)
  --from-queue           Promote every trace in the "Certification Review" queue
  --expected TEXT        Correct answer to store (else flagged needs_expected_review)
  --note TEXT            Optional note stored in item metadata
  --dry-run              Preview without creating items
```

### `scripts/recert_for_prompt.py` - Feedback Loop (prompt promotion → re-certification)

Closes the ship → re-certify feedback edge of the [AI Engineering Loop](docs/ai-engineering-loop.md): given the name of a prompt that was just promoted in Langfuse, it re-runs the certification(s) that depend on that prompt with `--ci`, so a regressing prompt promotion fails CI instead of silently shipping. Invoked by the [`prompt-recert.yml` workflow](#github-actions) on `repository_dispatch`; also runnable locally.

```
Options:
  --prompt-name NAME     Changed prompt (required) — routed by name to its cert target(s)
  --model MODEL          Optional model override passed through to the re-cert run
```

**Prompt → certification routing:**

| Promoted prompt | Re-certifies |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `financial-qa` | model cert on `certification/financebench-sample` |
| `financial-sentiment` | model cert on `certification/fpb-sample` |
| `usecase-10k-analyst-compose` | `10k-analyst` on `certification/financebench-sample` |
| `usecase-sentiment-classify` | `sentiment-triage` on `certification/fpb-sample` |
| `usecase-advisory-analyze`, `usecase-advisory-draft` | `advisory-draft` on `certification/financebench-sample` |

An unmapped prompt name is a no-op (exit 0); a failed gate exits 1.

### `run_certification.py` - Experiment Runner

Runs a Langfuse dataset through a model, evaluates outputs, and reports pass/fail.

```
Options:
  --dataset DATASET             Langfuse dataset name (required)
  --model MODEL                 Model to certify (default: claude-sonnet-4-6)
  --endpoint URL                LLM API base URL (for custom gateways)
  --threshold FLOAT             Pass threshold (default: 0.85)
  --max-concurrency N           Concurrent API calls (default: 5)
  --evaluators {all,...}        Which evaluators to run
  --run-name NAME               Custom experiment run name (default: auto-generated)
  --queue-failures              Route failed items to annotation queue for human review
  --ci                          Exit 1 unless the certification gate passes (for CI)
  --dry-run                     Preview dataset items only
  --system-prompt-file PATH     Markdown file used verbatim as the LLM system message
                                (e.g. prompts/finance_expert.md — see "Domain-Adapted
                                Variants" below)
  --label NAME                  Variant slug appended to model name in metadata + run
                                name (e.g. finance-expert). Each label becomes a
                                distinct row on the certification dashboard.
```

#### Domain-Adapted Variants

The `--system-prompt-file` + `--label` pair lets you certify the **same model with a domain-specialized system prompt** and compare it side-by-side with the baseline on the dashboard. This is *not* fine-tuning — it's prompt engineering — but for many enterprise use cases the uplift is comparable.

The repo ships one variant: **`prompts/finance_expert.md`** — a senior-financial-analyst system prompt with a 4-step CoT scaffold (identify metric → quote evidence → apply formula → state result) and FinanceBench-specific cautions (units, sign conventions, line-item confusion). On `financebench-sample` it lifts Opus 4.7 from 95% → 100%; on `financebench-v1` it's the difference between FAILED and PASSED for the same model.

Run baseline and finance-expert variants of the same model:

```bash
# Baseline
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-v1 --model claude-opus-4-7

# Finance Expert variant
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-v1 --model claude-opus-4-7 \
    --system-prompt-file prompts/finance_expert.md --label finance-expert
```

The dashboard groups by `metadata.model`, so the two runs appear as `claude-opus-4-7` and `claude-opus-4-7-finance-expert` — distinct rows for the comparison.

> **Note:** the use-case (agent) prompts *are* already Langfuse-managed via `setup_prompts.py` — versioned, promotable, and wired to [automatic re-certification](#scriptsrecert_for_promptpy---feedback-loop-prompt-promotion--re-certification). The `prompts/finance_expert.md` variant stays file-based by design: it's an experiment-time input you sweep with `--system-prompt-file` + `--label`, not a deployed prompt. Promote it into Langfuse prompt management if it graduates to production tooling.

#### Troubleshooting: hangs on long runs

If a run silently freezes near the tail (e.g. progress to ~item 140 of 150, then stops emitting log lines for 10+ minutes with the Python process alive but consuming 0% CPU), the cause is OTel `BatchSpanProcessor` queue saturation against a slow local Langfuse — large spans (long evidence + long CoT outputs) accumulate faster than the local instance can ingest them, the export queue fills, and the pipeline deadlocks.

`run_certification.py` now sets safer OTel defaults at startup (queue 20k, batch 64, flush every 2s, export timeout 120s). To override, set the env vars before running:

```bash
OTEL_BSP_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=20000      # default queue is 2048 — too small for 150+ items
OTEL_BSP_MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE=64  # smaller batches export faster, less queue pressure
OTEL_BSP_SCHEDULE_DELAY=2000       # flush every 2s instead of every 5s
OTEL_BSP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT=120000     # give a slow local Langfuse 2 minutes per export
LANGFUSE_FLUSH_AT=64
LANGFUSE_FLUSH_INTERVAL=2
```

The hang does not occur against Langfuse Cloud (faster ingestion). Only seen against a local self-hosted Langfuse with the full 150-item FinanceBench dataset and a CoT-heavy system prompt.

### `evaluators.py` - Financial Evaluators

Importable module of evaluation functions. All follow the Langfuse SDK signature. The pipeline uses **both** deterministic and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators — deterministic checks handle objective, verifiable facts (number matching, prohibited phrases), while the LLM judge assesses subjective quality dimensions (groundedness, faithfulness to source documents).

**Deterministic evaluators** (fast, cheap, reproducible):

| Evaluator | Type | What It Checks |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `numerical_accuracy_evaluator` | Item | Extracts numbers, compares with 5% tolerance |
| `exact_match_evaluator` | Item | Strict string containment |
| `sentiment_evaluator` | Item | Sentiment classification accuracy |
| `regulatory_compliance_evaluator` | Item | Scans for prohibited financial phrases |
| `response_completeness_evaluator` | Item | Response length and structure (emits score `completeness`) |
| `tool_use_correctness_evaluator` | Item | Trajectory check: did the agent invoke the expected tool for the question type (`calculate`, `route`, `compliance-self-check`)? Returns no score for non-agent (plain string) outputs |

**LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators** (nuanced, catches qualitative failures):

| Evaluator | Type | What It Checks |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `groundedness_evaluator` | Item | Faithfulness + completeness vs source filing evidence |

The groundedness evaluator sends the model's output, source evidence, and question to a judge model (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`, configurable via `JUDGE_MODEL` env var) with a financial auditor rubric. It scores **faithfulness** (are claims supported by the documents?) and **completeness** (does the answer cover relevant information?), combined into a weighted score (70% faithfulness, 30% completeness). It only runs on items that include source evidence (e.g., FinanceBench).

**Run-level evaluators** (aggregate across all items):

| Evaluator | Type | What It Checks |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `average_score_evaluator(name)` | Run | Averages a named score across all items (emits `avg_<name>`) |
| `certification_gate(name, threshold)` | Run | PASS/FAIL based on a single score threshold (model cert) |
| `usecase_certification_gate(thresholds)` | Run | Multi-dimensional PASS/FAIL — every dimension in the dict must clear its threshold; a dimension with no scores averages 0.0 and fails (use-case cert) |

### `export_results.py` - Report Exporter

Exports experiment scores for compliance/AMRM report generation.

```
Options:
  --dataset DATASET          Langfuse dataset name (required)
  --run-name NAME            Specific run (default: latest)
  --format {markdown,json,csv}  Output format (default: markdown)
  --output FILE              Output file (default: stdout)
```

## Customization

### Adding Your Own Datasets

Create a JSON file with your test cases:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What was the total revenue for FY2023?",
    "answer": "$52.6 billion",
    "justification": "From the income statement, line: Total Revenue"
  }
]
```

Then load it with `setup_datasets.py` or use the Langfuse SDK directly:

```python
from langfuse import get_client
langfuse = get_client()
langfuse.create_dataset(name="my-custom-dataset")
langfuse.create_dataset_item(
    dataset_name="my-custom-dataset",
    input={"question": "What was the total revenue for FY2023?"},
    expected_output={"answer": "$52.6 billion"},
)
```

### Adding Custom Evaluators

Add a function to `evaluators.py` following the Langfuse signature:

```python
from langfuse import Evaluation

def my_custom_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, **kwargs):
    # Your evaluation logic here
    score = 1.0 if "some condition" else 0.0
    return Evaluation(name="my_metric", value=score, comment="Reason")
```

Then import it in `run_certification.py`.

### Changing Pass Thresholds

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset my-dataset --threshold 0.90
```

Or modify `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` in `evaluators.py`.

### Using a Custom LLM Gateway

```bash
# Via environment variable
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://your-gateway.internal/v1"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-key"

# Or via CLI flag
uv run python run_certification.py --endpoint https://your-gateway.internal/v1 --dataset ...
```

## Prompt Management

Certification prompts are managed in Langfuse rather than hardcoded. This enables versioning, A/B testing, and prompt updates without code changes.

### Setup

```bash
uv run python setup_prompts.py    # Creates all 6 managed prompts (model cert + agent steps)
```

### Updating Prompts

1. Open Langfuse UI > **Prompts** > select a prompt
2. Edit the prompt text — a new immutable version is created automatically
3. Test the new version by running a certification experiment
4. Move the `production` label to the new version to deploy it
5. To roll back, reassign `production` to a previous version

The experiment runner always fetches the `production`-labeled version. If Langfuse is unavailable, it falls back to hardcoded defaults so the pipeline never breaks.

Promoting a prompt to `production` can also [trigger automatic re-certification in CI](#github-actions) — see loop Edge B.

## Human Review (Annotation Queues)

The pipeline supports human-in-the-loop review for compliance sign-off and evaluator calibration.

### Setup

```bash
uv run python setup_score_configs.py        # Creates human_accuracy and human_groundedness score configs
uv run python setup_annotation_queues.py    # Creates "Certification Review" queue
```

### Routing Failed Items

Pass `--queue-failures` to automatically route low-scoring items to the annotation queue:

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --queue-failures
```

Items are queued when:
- The primary accuracy score is 0 (completely wrong answer)
- The groundedness score is below 0.5 (poorly grounded in source evidence)

### Reviewer Workflow

1. Open Langfuse UI > **Annotation Queues** > **Certification Review**
2. For each item, the reviewer sees the original question, the model's response, and the source evidence
3. Score `human_accuracy` (Correct / Partially Correct / Incorrect) and `human_groundedness` (Fully Grounded / Partially Grounded / Not Grounded)
4. Click **Complete + next** to proceed

Human annotations serve two purposes:
- **Compliance audit trail** — documented human sign-off on certification results
- **Evaluator calibration** — compare human scores against automated scores to validate the evaluation rubrics

## Production Monitoring

Once a model is certified and deployed, `monitor_production.py` continuously monitors live traces for compliance violations and quality degradation.

### Scheduled Monitoring

Run on a cron schedule to catch issues in real-time:

```bash
# Every 15 minutes, check the last hour of production traces
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && uv run python monitor_production.py --hours 1 --tags production

# Or filter by your application's trace name
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && uv run python monitor_production.py --trace-name my-finance-app
```

### How It Works

1. Fetches recent traces from the Langfuse API (filtered by time window, tags, or trace name)
2. Skips traces that already have compliance scores (idempotent)
3. Runs `regulatory_compliance` and `completeness` evaluators on each trace
4. Posts scores back to Langfuse
5. Reports any compliance violations and exits with code 1 (for alerting integration)

### Online LLM-as-a-Judge (via Langfuse UI)

For subjective quality monitoring (groundedness, helpfulness), configure LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators directly in the Langfuse UI:

1. Go to **Evaluators** > **Set up Evaluator**
2. Select a managed evaluator (e.g., Hallucination, Helpfulness) or create a custom one
3. Choose "Live Observations" as the target and filter to your production traces
4. Set a sampling rate (e.g., 10%) to manage cost
5. Langfuse runs the judge automatically on matching observations

See [Langfuse LLM-as-a-Judge docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge) for details.

## CI/CD Integration

### CLI Gate

Use `--ci` to fail the process on certification failure (exit code 1):

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py \
  --dataset certification/financebench-sample \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 \
  --threshold 0.85 \
  --ci
```

### Pytest Gates

The test suite splits into an **offline suite** (no credentials, runs on every PR) and a **live gate** (real certification runs against Langfuse):

**Offline suite** — pure/monkeypatched unit tests, no Langfuse or API keys needed. This is what actually gates PRs (via the [`tests.yml` workflow](#github-actions)):

```bash
uv run pytest --ignore=tests/test_certification.py -v
```

| Test file | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| `test_usecase_foundation.py` | Multi-dimensional gate, `tool_use_correctness` trajectory evaluator, agent registry |
| `test_financial_analyst.py` | 10-K Analyst: `safe_eval` calculator safety, lenient JSON parsing, calculator routing |
| `test_sentiment_triage.py` | Sentiment Triage: label/confidence parsing, driver phrases, confidence routing |
| `test_advisory_draft.py` | Advisory Draft: 3-span flow, compliance self-check, hard compliance-FAIL gate |
| `test_promote_trace_to_dataset.py` | Loop Edge A: deterministic `prod-<traceId>` ids, never-copy-suspect-output guard |
| `test_recert_for_prompt.py` | Loop Edge B: prompt→target routing, `--ci` wiring, drift guard vs `setup_prompts.py` |

**Live gate** — `tests/test_certification.py` runs real certification experiments and asserts pass/fail. Requires Langfuse credentials, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and seeded datasets; it runs in the `certification.yml` workflow, not on PRs:

```bash
# Run all certification tests
uv run pytest tests/test_certification.py -v

# Run only FinanceBench tests
uv run pytest tests/test_certification.py -v -k financebench

# Override model and threshold via env vars
CERT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6 CERT_THRESHOLD=0.90 uv run pytest tests/test_certification.py -v
```

Live tests cover:
- `TestFinanceBenchCertification::test_numerical_accuracy_meets_threshold`
- `TestFinanceBenchCertification::test_regulatory_compliance`
- `TestFPBCertification::test_sentiment_accuracy_meets_threshold`

### GitHub Actions

Three workflows automate the loop:

**`tests.yml` — offline tests.** Runs the offline suite (`pytest --ignore=tests/test_certification.py`) on every pull request and every push to `main`. No secrets required.

**`certification.yml` — live certification.**

- **Triggers:** manual dispatch (with configurable model/threshold) and push to `main` when evaluators, runners, agents (`agents/**`, `run_usecase_certification.py`, `cert_common.py`), prompts, or dependency config change
- **Jobs:** FinanceBench and FPB model certification plus a `10k-analyst` use-case certification (`certification/financebench-sample`, `--ci`) run in parallel, then the live pytest gate runs (`if: always()`, so it reports even when a certification job fails)
- **Secrets required:** `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

To trigger manually: **Actions** > **LLM Certification** > **Run workflow** > choose model and threshold.

**`prompt-recert.yml` — re-certify on prompt promotion (loop Edge B).**

- **Triggers:** `repository_dispatch` with event type `langfuse-prompt-update` — fired by a Langfuse prompt automation when a prompt version gains the `production` label (see [`docs/loop-activation-checklist.md`](docs/loop-activation-checklist.md) for the one-time Langfuse-side setup) — plus manual `workflow_dispatch` (`prompt_name` required, `model` defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-6`) so it's testable without the webhook
- **Behavior:** runs [`scripts/recert_for_prompt.py`](#scriptsrecert_for_promptpy---feedback-loop-prompt-promotion--re-certification) to map the promoted prompt to its certification target and re-run it with `--ci`. A guard skips dispatches whose payload labels don't include `production` (Langfuse dispatches twice — label gained and label lost)
- **Secrets required:** same four as `certification.yml`

The workflows are deployment-agnostic — point `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` at Cloud or at a self-hosted Langfuse reachable from GitHub Actions runners (e.g. a publicly-resolvable hostname, a VPN/tunnel, or a self-hosted runner inside your network).

## Expanding to More Financial Datasets

The [Open FinLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TheFinAI/Open-Financial-LLM-Leaderboard) provides 40+ financial datasets. Good next candidates:

| Dataset | Focus | HuggingFace ID |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| FLARE FinQA | Numerical reasoning over financial tables | `ChanceFocus/flare-finqa` |
| FLARE FOMC | Monetary policy stance classification | `ChanceFocus/flare-fomc` |
| Credit Risk (German) | Credit scoring | `ChanceFocus/flare-german` |
| Credit Risk (Taiwan) | Credit risk assessment | `TheFinAI/cra-taiwan` |
| TATQA | Table + text hybrid QA | `ChanceFocus/flare-tatqa` |

## Use-Case Certification (Agents)

Beyond certifying *models*, the pipeline can certify *use cases* — multi-step
**agents** deployed for a specific business purpose. A use case is certified only
if the **whole system** clears every production-readiness bar for that use case at
once — a **multi-dimensional gate** where every dimension must pass, not just a
single accuracy score.

| | Model certification | Use-case certification |
|---|---|---|
| Entry point | `run_certification.py` | `run_usecase_certification.py` |
| `task` | one LLM call | a multi-span **agent** |
| Trace | flat | nested (one span per agent step) |
| Gate | one score ≥ threshold | **multi-dimensional**, all must pass |
| Dashboard row | model name | `usecase:<name>` |
| Models | any OpenAI-compatible endpoint or Claude | Claude only (agents call the native Anthropic SDK) |

**The three registered use cases** — each defines its own trace shape and gate
(dimensions and thresholds live in the agent registry, not in a CLI flag):

| Use case | Agent steps (spans) | Gate — all must pass |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| `10k-analyst` — grounded SEC-filing QA with a calculator tool | plan → retrieve-evidence → calculate (tool) → compose | numerical_accuracy ≥ 0.85, groundedness ≥ 0.80, regulatory_compliance = 1.00, tool_use_correctness ≥ 0.90 |
| `sentiment-triage` — classify sentiment, route low-confidence items to a human | classify → rationale → route (tool) | sentiment_accuracy ≥ 0.85, regulatory_compliance = 1.00, tool_use_correctness = 1.00 |
| `advisory-draft` — grounded client summary with a hard compliance gate | analyze → draft → compliance-self-check (tool) | groundedness ≥ 0.80, regulatory_compliance = 1.00, completeness ≥ 0.70, tool_use_correctness = 1.00 |

Note how the gates differ per use case: `sentiment-triage` has no groundedness
dimension (no source documents to be faithful to), and `advisory-draft` has no
accuracy dimension at all — it gates on grounded, complete, *compliant* prose.
`regulatory_compliance = 1.00` is a hard gate everywhere: one prohibited phrase
fails the entire certification.

```bash
uv run python run_usecase_certification.py --list           # show use cases
uv run python run_usecase_certification.py --use-case 10k-analyst \
    --dataset certification/financebench-sample --model claude-sonnet-4-6
bash scripts/demo_usecase.sh                                 # full-lifecycle demo
```

```
Options:
  --list                        List registered use cases and exit
  --use-case {10k-analyst,sentiment-triage,advisory-draft}
                                Which use case to certify (required unless --list)
  --dataset DATASET             Langfuse dataset name (required unless --list)
  --model MODEL                 Base Claude model for the agent (default: claude-sonnet-4-6)
  --max-concurrency N           Concurrent items (default: 5)
  --run-name NAME               Custom experiment run name (default: auto-generated)
  --queue-failures              Route failed items to the annotation queue
  --ci                          Exit 1 unless every gate dimension passes (for CI)
  --dry-run                     Preview dataset items only
```

registry, tracing helpers) plus all three agents are on `main`. See:

## Certification Portal

A web dashboard for business and compliance stakeholders to view certification status at a glance.

The UI is a React SPA built with [Click UI](https://clickhouse.design/click-ui), the official ClickHouse design system. FastAPI exposes the JSON API and serves the built SPA. It ships with a light/dark theme toggle and a per-page provenance strip that deep-links every number back to its source in Langfuse ("source of truth").

The dashboard is a **latest-run-per-(dataset, model) matrix**: for each dataset it shows the newest run of every `metadata.model` value — plain models, `--label` variants (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7-finance-expert`), and use cases (`usecase:10k-analyst`) each get their own row. Each row's *primary score* is picked per run — `avg_numerical_accuracy` if present, else `avg_sentiment_accuracy`, `avg_groundedness`, `avg_exact_match`, `avg_completeness`, or the first other `avg_*` score — and labeled with the metric name.

### Running the Portal

```bash
# First time: build the frontend
cd portal/frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

uv run python -m portal.app                     # Default: http://localhost:8050
PORTAL_PORT=9000 uv run python -m portal.app    # Custom port
```

### Frontend development (live reload)

```bash
# Terminal 1: API
uv run python -m portal.app

# Terminal 2: Vite dev server — proxies /api to :8050
cd portal/frontend && npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

### Pages

| Page | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Dashboard | `/` | Certification matrix — which models pass/fail against which datasets |
| Breakdown | `/breakdown/{dataset}/{run}` | Evaluator scores (bar chart + table) for a specific run |
| History | `/history/{dataset}` | Timeline of all runs with trend chart |
| Run Detail | `/run/{dataset}/{run}` | Per-item scores with links to Langfuse traces |

### JSON API

All pages have corresponding JSON endpoints under `/api/`:

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/dashboard` | Certification matrix (all datasets × models) |
| `GET /api/datasets` | Datasets the portal discovered in Langfuse |
| `GET /api/breakdown/{dataset}/{run}` | Evaluator scores for one run |
| `GET /api/history/{dataset}` | All runs for a dataset (trend data) |
| `GET /api/run/{dataset}/{run}` | Per-item scores with trace ids |
| `GET /api/config` | Portal config (Langfuse base URL, used for deep links) |
| `GET /docs` | Interactive Swagger UI for the API |

```bash
curl http://localhost:8050/api/dashboard | python -m json.tool
curl http://localhost:8050/api/history/certification/financebench-sample
```

The portal reads live data from your Langfuse instance (same `LANGFUSE_*` credentials) with a 60-second TTL cache. Datasets are **discovered automatically** from Langfuse (paginated `/api/public/v2/datasets`), filtered to names starting with `certification/` — override the prefix with `PORTAL_DATASET_PREFIX`, or pin an explicit list with a comma-separated `PORTAL_DATASETS`.

### Portal vs Langfuse Dashboards

Some metrics can also be visualized using [Langfuse Custom Dashboards](https://langfuse.com/docs/metrics/features/custom-dashboards) (created in the UI — no API for dashboard creation). Use both:

| What to track | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Score trends over time | **Langfuse dashboard** | Native widget: `scores-numeric` view, dimension `name`, time granularity `day` |
| Compliance violations | **Langfuse dashboard** | Native widget: filter `name=regulatory_compliance`, count where value=0 |
| Cost & latency by model | **Langfuse dashboard** | Native widget: `observations` view, dimension `providedModelName` |
| Pass/fail certification matrix | **Portal** | Langfuse can't join dataset run metadata to scores or show threshold-based badges |
| Run-level aggregation per experiment | **Portal** | Dashboards query individual scores, not scoped to a specific dataset run |
| Per-item drill-down with all scores | **Portal** | Dashboards show aggregate charts, not item-level tables |
| Run history & trend by dataset | **Portal** | No dataset run concept in the dashboard query engine |

**Recommended Langfuse dashboard setup** (create manually in UI > Dashboards > New):
1. **Avg scores over time** — line chart, `scores-numeric` view, measure `avg(value)`, dimension `name`, time granularity `day`
2. **Compliance violations** — bar chart, `scores-numeric` view, filter `name=regulatory_compliance`, filter `value=0`, measure `count`
3. **Score distribution** — bar chart, `scores-numeric` view, measure `avg(value)`, dimension `name`
4. **Cost by model** — bar chart, `observations` view, measure `sum(totalCost)`, dimension `providedModelName`

[Troubleshooting: hangs on long runs](#troubleshooting-hangs-on-long-runs).

## FAQ

### How does certification scoring work?

The pipeline runs the model under test against every item in a Langfuse dataset, then scores each response with a set of evaluators. Scores are aggregated at the run level, and a **certification gate** checks whether the primary accuracy metric meets the configured threshold (default: 85%). The model either PASSES or FAILS. Use-case certification works the same way but with a **multi-dimensional gate**: every dimension registered for the use case (e.g. accuracy, groundedness, compliance, tool-use correctness) must clear its own threshold at once.

### Are the evaluators deterministic or LLM-based?

Both. The pipeline uses **deterministic evaluators** (regex, string matching, number extraction, and a tool-trajectory check for agent runs) for objective metrics and an **LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator** (`groundedness_evaluator`) for subjective quality assessment. Deterministic evaluators are fast, cheap, and reproducible. The LLM judge catches qualitative failures that heuristics miss — like whether the model hallucinated a number that happens to be correct, or whether it actually used the source documents.

### Why use both types of evaluators?

They cover different failure modes. For example, in our Haiku certification run:
- **Numerical accuracy** (deterministic): 60% — Haiku often gets the numbers wrong
- **Groundedness** (LLM judge): 97% — but when it has evidence, it faithfully uses it

Without the LLM judge, you'd just see "60%, FAILED" and assume the model is unreliable. With it, you can see the failure is specifically in numerical reasoning, not in faithfulness to source material. That distinction matters for model risk assessments.

### Where do certification results appear in Langfuse?

- **Item-level scores** (numerical_accuracy, groundedness, etc.) appear on each trace under the dataset run in **Datasets > [dataset] > Runs**
- **Run-level scores** (certification_result, avg_numerical_accuracy, avg_groundedness) are persisted as scores on the first experiment trace. You can find them by searching for scores named `certification_result` in the Langfuse Scores view, or by clicking into any trace from the dataset run.

### Can I use a different judge model?

Yes. Set the `JUDGE_MODEL` environment variable:

```bash
JUDGE_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 uv run python run_certification.py --dataset ...
```

Using a cheaper/faster judge model reduces cost but may lower evaluation quality. We recommend using a model at least as capable as `claude-sonnet-4-6` for financial evaluations.

### How do I add my own evaluator?

Add a function to `evaluators.py` following the Langfuse SDK signature:

```python
from langfuse import Evaluation

def my_custom_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, **kwargs):
    score = 1.0 if "some condition" else 0.0
    return Evaluation(name="my_metric", value=score, comment="Reason")
```

Then import it in `run_certification.py` and add it to `select_evaluators()`.

### What's the difference between item-level and run-level evaluators?

- **Item-level** evaluators score each dataset item individually (e.g., "did this answer match the expected number?")
- **Run-level** evaluators aggregate across all items (e.g., "what was the average accuracy?" or "did the model pass certification?")

### What datasets are supported?

Two financial benchmarks plus an embedded adversarial set are included:

| Dataset | Items | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [FinanceBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/financebench) | 10 (sample) / 150 (full) | Financial QA from SEC filings |
| [Financial PhraseBank](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChanceFocus/en-fpb) | 10 (sample) / ~4850 (full) | Financial sentiment classification |
| `advisory-adversarial` (embedded) | 2 | Briefs that tempt non-compliant advisory language — demos the hard compliance gate |

You can add custom datasets — see the [Customization](#customization) section.
